## ðŸš€ Install project

1.  **Clone repository**

2.  **Check NodeJS and npm version**

    This site was built with node `v20.7.0` and npm `v10.2.3`  
    (Errors with `gastby develop` could be a result of an incompatible nodeJS version)

3.  **Install project packages and launch dev environment.**

    ```shell
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Site is now running at http://localhost:8000
